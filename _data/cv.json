      "description": "We implemented and evaluated multiple deep learning models, including CLIP, DINOv2, EfficientNet, ResNet, and GoogLeNet. Each model extracts feature embeddings from query and gallery images using a pretrained or fine-tuned encoder. Retrieval is performed by ranking gallery images according to cosine similarity with the query embedding. We tested both frozen and fine-tuned variants, and evaluated the impact of different pooling strategies (GAP vs. GeM) on retrieval performance."
